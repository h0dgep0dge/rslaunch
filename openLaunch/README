I've written 3 programs to demo using the auth process
    - proof.py was the first i finished, it goes through the entire process and launches runelite at the end, this serves no real purpose other than posterity
    - setup.py and launch.py are slightly better, setup.py writes a configuration file with the session key, and launch.py uses it to start runelite
    
Please don't daily drive this software! It is not ready. It's badly engineered, fragile, and worst of all annoying to use. I also don't have the blessing of Jagex, so you might get yourself banned who knows
